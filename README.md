This is the frontend of the Garatéa initiative website.

# What is it

Garatéa, or lifeguard in Tupi-guarani, is a network formation initiative that aims at increasing the survival rate of medical emergencies creating teams of first responders inside the civilian communities, so that they can aid in the emergency care while the victims wait for the arrival of the paramedics. We value universality, cooperation and living together in communities.

# Technology

This frontend was developed in Angular 2 and expects a RESTFUL backend to handle e-mail communications.
